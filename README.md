# hsrminer
Miner software for various hashing algorithms (currenlty Nvidia-only) by palgin & alexkap

palgin - CUDA-related stuff
alexkap - C++/C-related stuff

We'll start with HSR algo (Hcash) and will try to keep up with 5-10% higher speeds than existing free software offers.

Current testing speeds:

1060 3Gb - 8.3+ Mh/s on hsr

1080 - 16.2+ Mh/s on hsr

Product will contain devfee 1% (0.5% for me, 0.5% for alexkap) and will be close-sourced, but voluntary work won't be abandoned.

Will update that page with bins and instructions once closed-beta test ends. 
Beta will last from the beginning of December until 24-25th of December.

Everyone who want to participate - write me PM on bitcointalk.org forum (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=828408).

Thanks for viewing this page and have a nice day! ;)
